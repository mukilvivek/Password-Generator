# Password-Generator
Summary

This project consists of two files. The password maker file generates a password for the user, and the password tester tests the password against common rules required for a password. The password maker file has a user interface that allows the user to click a button, which in turn will generate a password. The password tester file lists out all the conditions it is checking for, then when the user inputs a password, it will say whether or not it is a valid password.


Implementation

For the password maker file run the program then a user interface will pop up. Cick the button that is shown and a password will be generated for you to use. For the password checker file run the program and then input the password you want checked. The rules that are being checked for will be displayed on the program and then the program will output whether or not the password you entered is a strong password.
